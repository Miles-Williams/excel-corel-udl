# excel-corel-udl
Excel and CorelDRAW automation. VBA code for creating Corel layout from Excel data

Created for CorelDRAW X6 and Excel 2013.

Automates the task of drawing up files to be used for laser etching UDL's (Ultra Destructible Labels)

UDL's are used as serial number labels on products as they are extremely difficult to tamper with.

This Excel/Corel automation gives the option of creating the drawing from a column of values, either created or pasted into the document, or by providing a start and end serial number.
